WhichJS
========================

  Have you ever navigated to a website and wonder what JavaScript framework is used
to build this marvelous site? If you are like me, you would open up you web inspector/firebug
and try to "console.log()" out which JS Framework is present.

 With the plethora of JavaScript frameworks out there, 
it is more difficult to know which JS framework is used right away. Not to mention 
that many websites nowadays use more than one JS framework together.

  By using this simply script to find out what JS framework is used, you can get a real feel of what JS framework is generally suited for what kind of websites, what version
of the framework is used and an added bonus is that you may stumble across a great website built with a framework you never hear before.

#Usage
  Add the content in build.js as a bookmark in your browser. Click on the bookmark whenever you
need to find out about js frameworks at a website. Check out [jQuerify Bookmarklet](http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/12/jquerify-bookmarklet) for a detailed explanation of how
this kind of snippets can be used.

#Please Contribute
  This project will be much more complete if you can submit pull requests to improve the robustness
of JS Framework detections, fix errors.
